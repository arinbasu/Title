<p>How about writing in markdown and then using my pandoc and git to create an html file and then uploading that html file to Authorea.</p>
<p>So, this workflow means:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Start writing in markdown</li>
<li>Add citation from bibtex file directly in the Atom editor</li>
<li>Use pandoc to convert this section to html</li>
<li>upload through git bridge to Authorea</li>
<li>Add the html file to the layout.md</li>
<li>Update</li>
</ol>
<p>It should show up where we want to show up. Will it?</p>
<p>The dicey thing is the citation bit. Let's see. If I want to add a citation by Carolina Menezes <span class="citation">(Menezes et al. 2013)</span> (by the way I need to set the correct file for Pandoc to work) and write:</p>
<p><code>pandoc -f markdown -t html --filter pandoc-citeproc --bibliography bibliography/biblio.bib -o one.html</code> Then modify the layout.md file to include one.html and upload everything.</p>
<p>Will it work?</p>
