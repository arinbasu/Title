<h2>The idea is to bring in people to write collaboratively</h2><div>How about writing in markdown and then using my pandoc and git to create an html file and then uploading that html file to Authorea.</div><div>So, this workflow means:</div><ol><li>Start writing in markdown</li><li>Add citation from bibtex file directly in the Atom editor</li><li>Use pandoc to convert this section to html</li><li>upload through git bridge to Authorea</li><li>Add the html file to the layout.md</li><li>Update</li></ol><div>It should show up where we want to show up. Will it?</div><div>The dicey thing is the citation bit. Let's see. If I want to add a citation by Carolina Menezes <span>(Menezes et al. 2013)</span> (by the way I need to set the correct file for Pandoc to work) and write:</div><div><code>pandoc -f markdown -t html --filter pandoc-citeproc --bibliography bibliography/biblio.bib -o one.html</code> Then modify the layout.md file to include one.html and upload everything.</div><div>Will it work?</div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div></div>
