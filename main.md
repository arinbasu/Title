Here is a simplified workflow to work with Atom (the text editor I use
to write Markdown),  Pandoc, Git/Github (Authorea connects through
Github but can use Gitlab or Bitbucket as well, see instructions), and
Authorea. This is important for a number of reasons even if I'd like to
work with markdown on my own editor and would like to use markdown in
Authorea or LaTeX in authorea:

1.  Markdown is simple
2.  Pandoc is a godsend swiss army knife for conversion
3.  People prefer RTF/WYSIWYG so collaboration is a breeze
4.  Authorea supports html for editing like in Google Docs so this will
    work in any browser (if it works in Vivaldi it will work anywhere)
5.  Citation support in Authorea is now great so that I can bring in
    bibtex entries from wherever on earth I want and push/pull
6.  On my end I can do whatever I like in Markdown/Pandoc I don't have
    to worry about the appearances and what goes here in Authorea. I can
    still take advantage of the collaborative editing/Word/LaTeX
    conversion in an html interface. 
7.  Basically, then everything works.

Here are the steps {#auto-label-subsection-318295 .ltx_title_subsection}
------------------

1.  Start a document with Authorea.
2.  Start with a blank document
3.  Set up the git bridge through github (just their basic git bridge,
    don't worry about getting the SHA-1 key crap)
4.  Go to github and copy the clone address
5.  In your terminal clone the github repo
6.  Write the paper in markdown
7.  Use pandoc to convert the markdown document(s) to html and save as
    standalone html document (see the code below)
8.  Fill in the bibliography/biblio.bib file with bibtex entries as
    needed
9.  Update your layout.md file to reflect the documents you want to show
    up
10. Now, git status, git pull/status/add (but add only html files)/push
11. The paragraphs, lists, formulae, tables should work out of the box.
    Citations and referencing should mess up, and not show the nice blue
    hyperlinks and neat referencing. Fix them in Authorea
12. Authorea edits, then git pull/git diff? changes?

Will this plan work? Too many steps?
