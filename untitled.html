<div></div><div>Here is a simplified workflow to work with Atom (the text editor I use to write Markdown), &nbsp;Pandoc, Git/Github (Authorea connects through Github but  can use Gitlab or Bitbucket as well, see instructions), and Authorea. This is important for a number of reasons even if I'd like to work with markdown on my own editor and would like to use markdown in Authorea or LaTeX in authorea:</div><div></div><ol><li>Markdown is simple</li><li>Pandoc is a godsend swiss army knife for conversion</li><li>People prefer RTF/WYSIWYG so collaboration is a breeze</li><li>Authorea supports html for editing like in Google Docs so this will work in any browser (if it works in Vivaldi it will work anywhere)</li><li>Citation support in Authorea is now great so that I can bring in bibtex entries from wherever on earth I want and push/pull</li><li>On my end I can do whatever I like in Markdown/Pandoc I don't have to worry about the appearances and what goes here in Authorea. I can still take advantage of the collaborative editing</li></ol><div></div><div></div><div><div>Menezes, Carolina Baptista, Maria Clara de Paula Couto, Luciano G Buratto, Fátima Erthal, Mirtes G Pereira, and Lisiane Bizarro. 2013. “The Improvement of Emotion and Attention Regulation After a 6-Week Training of Focused Meditation: A Randomized Controlled Trial.” <i>Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine</i> 2013.
