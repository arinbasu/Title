<div></div><div>Here is a simplified workflow to work with Atom (the text editor I use to write Markdown), &nbsp;Pandoc, Git/Github (Authorea connects through Github but  can use Gitlab or Bitbucket as well, see instructions), and Authorea. This is important for a number of reasons even if I'd like to work with markdown on my own editor and would like to use markdown in Authorea or LaTeX in authorea:</div><div></div><ol><li>Markdown is simple</li><li>Pandoc is a godsend swiss army knife for conversion</li><li>People prefer RTF/WYSIWYG so collaboration is a breeze</li><li>Authorea supports html for editing like in Google Docs so this will work in any browser (if it works in Vivaldi it will work anywhere)</li><li>Citation support in Authorea is now great so that I can bring in bibtex entries from wherever on earth I want and push/pull</li><li>On my end I can do whatever I like in Markdown/Pandoc I don't have to worry about the appearances and what goes here in Authorea. I can still take advantage of the collaborative editing/Word/LaTeX conversion in an html interface.&nbsp;</li><li>Basically, then everything works.&nbsp;</li></ol><div></div><h2 id="auto-label-subsection-318295" class="ltx_title_subsection">Here are the steps</h2><ol><li>Start a document with Authorea. </li><li>Start with a blank document</li><li>Set up the git bridge through github (just their basic git bridge, don't worry about getting the SHA-1 key crap)</li><li>Go to github and copy the clone address</li><li>In your terminal clone the github repo</li><li>Write the paper in markdown</li><li>Use pandoc to convert the markdown document(s) to html and save as standalone html document (see the code below)</li><li>Fill in the bibliography/biblio.</li><li>Update your layout.md file to reflect the documents</li><li>Fill</li></ol><div></div><div></div><div><div>Menezes, Carolina Baptista, Maria Clara de Paula Couto, Luciano G Buratto, Fátima Erthal, Mirtes G Pereira, and Lisiane Bizarro. 2013. “The Improvement of Emotion and Attention Regulation After a 6-Week Training of Focused Meditation: A Randomized Controlled Trial.” <i>Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine</i> 2013.
