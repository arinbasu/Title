If you want to write and add citations, use a tex extension. Then identify a bibtex formatted citation and use the citation ID to add texts. 
If you want to add tables and figures then use markdown boxes. 
then add them to the layout.md file where you want to appear. 
commit the changes. 

So then, if I want to cite the paper by Bruce Barret \cite{barrett2012meditation}, it will most likely show up as desired. So, references and citations should work either in the text or if you are planning to write from outside and sync, then use latex but you will not really need to worry about knowing a lot of latex. It'd be nice if the markdown mode can accommodate the citations. At the moment they don't.
